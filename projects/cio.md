This person I knew was starting a new nonprofit and he wanted me to create a Facebook compatible logo based on his original. This resulted in the following:

After further discussion, he said he wanted a website to be able to do the following:
 
1. Donations - They needed to be able to accept PayPal Donations.  
2. Mailing List - People need to be able to sign up to the mailing list.
3. Statement - The mission statement should have a place.
4. Gallery - There should be a place to upload images grouped based on events/folders.
5. Events - There needs to be a page listing all of the events planned and completed. 
6. Resources - A page to post local resources such as job opennings, etc.
7. Contact - There should be a contact form that sends the submission as an email.

### Design
We started by creating a simple design:

### Donations and Mailing List
This was really simple, as the donations just redirected to a paypal donation page and stay updated was a form that was handled by a 3rd party.

### Mission Statement
This was a pretty simple page which did not need to be remotley updated or anything.

### Gallery, Events, and Resources

These three sections are remotley controlled from Prismic. The events and resources section are simple card based lists that can expand:

The gallery also followed a similar design with the images having the option to be viewed in full screen.

### Contact

This page used a 3rd part form handler to submit the contact.
